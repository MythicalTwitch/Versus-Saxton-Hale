Versus-Saxton-Hale
==================

War3Evo's Version of Saxton-Hale.

It wasn't made by me, but I'm updating and rewriting code how I'd like to use it.

This is not the offical version of Saxton-Hale.


Version 1.50 - 29 Aug 2014

* Developing and Redesigning Saxton Hale to be easier to code for developers.   Splitting it off into "chunks of code".
* Testing the new Miku stuff, when it is ready we will release the model and sounds.   You check it out as it is developing at 198.204.248.109:27135
