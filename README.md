Versus-Saxton-Hale
==================

War3Evo's Version of Saxton-Hale.

It wasn't made by me, but I'm updating and rewriting code how I'd like to use it.

This is not the offical version of Saxton-Hale.

f you want to see the latest version of my development, see the "develop branch".

Version 1.50 - 29 Aug 2014

* Split off code into "chunks of code".
* Check out the new Miku Special at 198.204.248.109:27135
* Added forward Action:VSH_OnSpecialSelection(&iSpecial); so that developers can change the special before saxton hale is created.
